    Even though the trend report is shown in the application as ready for download, additional wait time might be
    required until the report is complete. You can set a wait time between 0 and 300 seconds.
    <b>Tip</b>: We recommend using '0' (the default setting) which means no wait time. If the trend report displays
    partial data only, increase to 10 seconds, and wait for the next build. Repeat as necessary until the report
    contains all the transaction information.
