    Hostname or IP address
    The server's Hostname or IP address. If the port of server is different from the default one,
    mention it by adding a colon character (:) and then the port number<br/>
    <b>Example</b>: myserver.mycompany.net or 182.138.255.1 or myserver.mycompany.net:81<br/>
    <br/>
    If the server requires to be accessed via a tenant, you can specify it by adding the tenant details to the Server field.<br/>
    <b>Example</b>: myserver.mycompany.net/?tenant=fa128c06-5436-413d-9cfa-9f04bb738df3 or
    182.138.255.1/?tenant=fa128c06-5436-413d-9cfa-9f04bb738df3 or
    myserver.mycompany.net:81/?tenant=fa128c06-5436-413d-9cfa-9f04bb738df3<br/>
    <br/>
    <b>Important</b>: Do not use the full URL of the server. <br/>
    For example, using https://myserver/LoadTest will fail. Instead, just specify 'myserver' value in 'Server'
    field and switch on the 'Use HTTPS Protocol' if secured protocol is required.
